# Stroke Prediction
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of patients having a stroke. Utilizing patient health data, the project aims to identify key factors that increase stroke risk and implement a model that healthcare professionals can use to screen for high-risk individuals.
## Part One: Data Overview & Preprocessing
We began by cleaning and preparing our dataset, resolving issues such as missing values and duplicate entries to ensure a solid foundation for our analysis.
## Part Two: Exploratory Data Analysis
Our analysis sought to understand the feature distributions and uncover insights about the factors that contribute to stroke risk, leveraging both visual and statistical methods.
## Part Three: Modeling
We evaluated several machine learning models, performed feature engineering, and fine tuned the models in order to maximize our results.
## Part Four: Deployment
The final model was deployed as part of a web application, providing a user-friendly interface for stroke risk assessment. The application is available [here](<https://stroke-prediction-web-app-bwappucx4qt8k5nqeg2x9yh.streamlit.app/>), and the code repository can be found [here](<https://github.com/justinpakzad/Stroke-Prediction-Web-App>).
